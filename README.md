# PhxFlowbite

This is a phoenix app created by following this [blog article](https://dev.to/themesberg/how-to-install-phoenix-elixir-with-tailwind-css-and-flowbite-229f) at dev.to with some adaptations to the file structure according to the Phoenix `1.7.2` version and light CSS modifications.

The application uses Tailwind CSS (used by default by Phoenix framework and some [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) building blocks

To start your Phoenix server:

- run `npm install` from the `assets` directory to istall the `flowbite` package
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
